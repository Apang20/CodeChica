      My name is <strong>Shauna Boyer</strong>. I graduated from Round Rock High School a long time ago. </p>
      <p>After high school I moved away, graduated from college, and taught at a two year technical college in South Carolina. I moved back to Texas about 4-ish years ago.</p>

    <p>
      I started in <em>Latinitas</em> by volunteering with a former coworker at Start-Up Chica a couple of years ago. I had such a good time at Start-Up Chica and was so impressed with their mission and all of the people that I met that day, I asked to be added to their volunteer list. I was a lab assistant for one cohort of Code Chicas and then I began leading the Code Chicas cohorts after that. Anyone who knows me - knows I <strong>LOVE</strong> my Chicas!
    </p>
   

       <p>
      I try to stay motivated by...waking up every day and asking myself how can I be better today than I was yesterday.
